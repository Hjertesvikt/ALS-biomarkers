# ALS-biomarkers

Better biomarkers of ALS could enable smaller and more targeted clinical trials. Partially to address this aim, the Prize for Life foundation collected de-identified records from ALS sufferers who participated in clinical trials and made them available to researchers in the PRO-ACT database.

PRO-ACT data was used to predict decline in ALS-FRS over the next 9 months[b] with accuracies exceeding chance and cliniciansâ€™ predictions[/b] and achieving root mean squared errors of ~54% ([u]which is not so good[/u]).

Mei-Lyn Ong, Pei Fang Tan and Joanna D. Holbrook attempted to build models to better [b]predict decline[/b] in the ALSFRS-R score and to [b]predict survival[/b]. They applied learning algorithms to the demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters in the training set to predict ALSFRS-R decline and the derived fast/slow progression and high/low death risk categories. They say their error in prediction is better than 20%.

What is interesting is that they published their results in 2017 in a comprehensive manner and it is possible to use them to provide information to guide a treatment from a reduced set of common biomarkers.

Next days I will be busy with other businesses but I would appreciate any feedback.
