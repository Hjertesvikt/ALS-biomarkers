                    <p>
                        It is indeed interesting to know if an ALS patient condition is stable or deteriorating. <br/>
                        Until 2018 there was little known biomarkers for ALS. <br/>
                        Thanks to analysis of the ALS database PRO-ACT, scientists learned that some common biomarkers may indicate how a patient situation is evolving. <br/>
                         <br/>
                        Here we use a simplified interpretation of their data. There are two types of ALS, slow and fast evolving. <br/>
                        So any biomarker level lay in one of three areas, worse than the fast evolving condition, better than the slow progression, or in between. <br/>
                        It is also interesting to know how the biomarker is evolving: Does it stay flat or it is worsening? So we ask for two values for each biomarker. <br/>

                            <p> It is important to prevent weight loss. Weight gain is recommended at a gradual pace, about 1-2 pounds gained per month until Body Mass Index (BMI) is in the 25-30 range.</p>
