                    <h1> What is the purpose of this page? </h1>
                    <p>
                        It is indeed interesting to know if an ALS patient condition is stable or deteriorating.<br/>
			Where is the scientific compass that can give you trusted information on a weekly basis?<br/>
<br>
                        Until 2018 there was little known biomarkers for ALS. 
                        Thanks to analysis of the ALS database PRO-ACT, scientists learned that some common biomarkers may indicate how a patient situation is evolving. <br/>
                         <br/>
			<b>What can you do with those information?</b><br>
			Ask to your doctor what kind of intervention would pull the offending biomarker in the right area.<br>
<br>
			<b>It cannot be as simple as that!</b><br>
			Certainly it is not enough to stabilize ALS, but now you can track in a scientific manner how the situation is evolving, at least <b>you have a compass</b>. <br>
			It is still up to your doctor to find how to correct the situation.<br>

                            <p> The normal value for alkaline phosphatase is 53 to 128 U/L for a 20- to 50-year-old man and 42 to 98 U/L for a 20- to 50-year-old woman. Normal values are slightly different if you are older than 60, or pregnant.</p>

                            <p> Albumin typically decreases during illness, particularly illnesses that have an inflammatory component. The normal range of albumin levels is 34 to 54 grams per liter (g/L).</p>

                            <p> The muscle cells in your body need CK to function. If this test shows that your CK levels are high, you may have muscle damage. Normal values at rest are usually between 60 and 174 IU/L.</p>

                            <p> It is important to prevent weight loss. Weight gain is recommended at a gradual pace, about 1 kg gained per month until Body Mass Index (BMI) is in the 25-30 range.</p>
